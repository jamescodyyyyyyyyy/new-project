  <h1>HOW ALL THIS STARTED</h1>
  <p>How will i start all this, okay let me start from after i graduated high school</p>
  <br>
  <p>all this started when i was suddenly thinking like a man it was very shocking for me too because i am a very jovial person and i b asically dont take anything seriously , and what actually triggered alkl this was i got insulted because i saw many girls with something to show out of the short time they spent in highschool but me i had nothingr so i got insulted by thatbut as God might have it i started making plans in how to get rich though i am still on the way but i am still striving hard to make something out of my self but i am not still satisfied at where i am , so since when i had made the decsion of making out of my life, i started to manage my time i am not the boss at that though but i am making progress
    i read many books to get to where i am today from business to romance novels yes romance novels i thought me copy writing and i have learnt alot and i am still learning
